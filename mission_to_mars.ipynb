    "## Step 1 - Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NASA Mars News\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "news_title = \"NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet\"\n",
    "\n",
    "news_p = \"Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visit the url for JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to find the image url to the full size `.jpg` image.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to save a complete url string for this image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "featured_image_url = 'https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/images/largesize/PIA16225_hires.jpg'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mars Weather\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visit the Mars Weather twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scrape the latest Mars weather tweet from the page. Save the tweet text for the weather report as a variable called `mars_weather`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "mars_weather = 'Sol 1801 (Aug 30, 2017), Sunny, high -21C/-5F, low -80C/-112F, pressure at 8.82 hPa, daylight 06:09-17:55'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mars Facts\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visit the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://space-facts.com/mars/) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mars Hemispheres\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visit the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image url to the full resolution image.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save both the image url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the Hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Append the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "hemisphere_image_urls = [\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Valles Marineris Hemisphere\", \"img_url\": \"...\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Cerberus Hemisphere\", \"img_url\": \"...\"},\n",
    "    {\"title\": \"Schiaparelli Hemisphere\", \"img_url\": \"...\"},\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.\n",

    "## Step 3 - Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Screenshots of your final application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.\n",
